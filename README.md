# **Conscious Models as a Necessary Step Toward AGI**

**Tagline:**
> _Bigger models aren't enough. AGI needs a world-and-self model that knows it's the thing doing the thinking._

This repo holds the LaTeX source for the paper:
> **Conscious Models as a Necessary Step Toward Artificial General Intelligence**
> Author: **Payton Ison — Lead Architect and Designer of the Singularity**

The paper argues that **conscious models**—globally accessible, self-referential, temporally deep world-and-self models that sit in the control loop—are not a nice-to-have on the way to AGI. They're a **necessary architectural ingredient**.

## **1. Quick Orientation**

- **What this is:**
    A publication-ready LaTeX paper that makes the case that you **cannot** get robust, open-ended AGI in realistic environments without something functionally equivalent to machine consciousness.
    
- **What it is not (yet):**
    - No code implementation of the architecture (you can add that here).
    - No simulation benchmarks (also a natural fit for this repo).
    
- **Audience:**    
    - AGI researchers and architects
    - Alignment / safety people
    - Cognitive science/philosophy of mind folks interested in machine consciousness
